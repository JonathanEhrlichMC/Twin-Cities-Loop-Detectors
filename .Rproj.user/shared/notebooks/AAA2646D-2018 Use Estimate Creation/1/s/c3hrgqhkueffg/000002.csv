"0","# Check that there's no missing data for class entrances, as all entrances should receive a classification.  If there are observations missing a classification, this is most likely due to incorrect data entry (conversion from sample class workbook to index has been audited multiple ways and de-bugged; therefore it is shown to have captured 100% of the data in the sample class workbooks).  Check if trail entrance exists; if trail entrance does not exist in Sample Class Workbook, check entrance descriptions.  If it doesn't exist in entrance descriptions, most likely this is data error.  Contact IA coordinator for corrections."
